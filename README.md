- I worked in a team of three with a global terrorism database, which included terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2021. 
- For my part, I built a support vector machine model to classify whether a terrorist attack would result in civilian deaths
and a logistic regression to determine the attack probability for which military personnel should be deployed.
- The source database contained over 214,000 rows with over 30 variables for each type of terrorist attack.
- One member completed a random forest model to predict the next country terrrorists may targert, and the other completed
a k-means clustering to classify attacks by weapon type
